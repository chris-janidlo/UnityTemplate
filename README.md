Empty Unity 5.6 project, set up for easy usage with git. Used to create a new project or join an existing project made with this template.

Attempts to come with "batteries included;" a complete git setup with `lfs`, useful post-merge hooks, and a Unity project set up to work perfectly with git.

# Usage

**Method 1** (new project):

1. Make new remote repository with final project name
2. Clone this with `git clone https://github.com/crassSandwich/UnityTemplate.git <project-name>`
3. Run `init.sh <remote-url>`

**Method 2** (onboarding extant project):

```
TODO:
make init take one of two flags: j or n. if n, do Method 1 behavior. if j, take a remote url as input and make the local repo the same as the given remote, but also do all the init stuff.
```

## Issues

Not tested on Windows.
