Template project with all the stuff I like to have in a new Unity project. Smash that green "use this template" button to get started.

This is also already setup for [git lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/), but that should be optional if you don't have it installed.

`init.sh` cleans up all the cruft from this template, and then commits those changes. It also creates a project directory structure to match the meta files in the repository. I recommend running it before opening the project in the editor.
